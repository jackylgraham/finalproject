Final Project!
This is a simple website which highlights myself! It is a staggered layuot (which I personally like) to add some sort of design style/layout. I hope you enjoy getting to know me a little bit more!

This file uses the following:
HTML file
CSS file
Javascript file
Bugs:
- Needs more content
- Needs additional updates to the mobile view to make sure the squares stack up evenly when the screen size gets smaller
- Add additional mobile view and browser view options when the screen is smaller
Content featured:
- Each of the boxes feature a rectangle that has a hover style to let the user know they are looking at a specific square
-  The box featuring the generated code for a random compliment came from this helpful codepen (please ignore the language featured!): https://codepen.io/sirjessthebrave/pen/WbrzGp
-   I removed the catpitlization code as it wasn't necessasry - you can feature that in the text itself
-   I updated the variables and text to allow the last 3rd variable to be the only item which updates
-   I added positive feedback to ensure people feel good about themselves when they click!
-   Need to work on styling - will need to add "getElementById" line items

I figured out how to embed maps, videos, and video games - the html code featured height and width which I adjust to fit the squares

Next steps:
- Project Status: I would say this is nearly complete- but eventually, I would like to add in more advanced styles, javascript and other API items to make the website less static and have more of a visual style.
- Get more advanced with Javascript
- FINALIZE Contact me section!
